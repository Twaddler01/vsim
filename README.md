# vsim
# Description
This is going to be an incremental / simulated gather-type "village" game with an evolution eventually to space. Keeping it in JS for ease of distribution and eventual, yet simplified, mobile app development and deployment.

# Updates
* (03-14-2024)
Various updates. Created new object function but decided to keep it the way it is. Worked on tooltip updates and working on a function to setup object elements more effectively. Only an array so far, but temporarily commented out upgradeData to test new array to create all objects in a loop.
* (03-04-2024)
Completed data.js (array variables) imports and added functions.js for function data. Worked on tooltip, design complete, but will add functionality to all resources soon, making it more dynanic.
* (03-03-2024)
Added tooltip and food. Working on consumption but got distracted on tooltip creation to show details of gain/loss of resources. Food will decrease with time from spoiling/consumption. Lots more work to do on it still.
* (03-01-2024)
Quite a bit of progress.  Objects will be completely dynamic at first, until branching off individually. Most core code for objects done and ready to add population and other types of objects that will be coded more statically.

Got data.js working, using functions for data arrays since there are many dynamic ids. This seems to be most efficient. May eventually add a functions.js to clean things up more. Working on more dynamic loops as functions to use for any type of object to reduce code redundancy. Still need to add button functionality, which is the next step. Will be working on population soon, which is going to function a bit different than upgrade or building objects.

Mainly working on structure and setup of primary functions. The challenge is keeping objects dynamic, which involves a lot of looping and a bit more complicated coding. Thanks be to "Chat GDP" AI for its fantastic coding assistance. Without it, I'd probably have much slower progress (and much less patience) with this type of coding.
