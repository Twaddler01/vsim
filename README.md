# Description
This is going to be an incremental / simulated gather-type "village" game with an evolution eventually to space. Keeping it in JS for ease od distribution and eventual, yet simplified, mobile app development and deployment.
# Updates
Mainly working on structure and setup of primary functions. The challenge is keeping objects dynamic, which involves a lot of looping and a bit more complicated coding. Thanks be to "Chat GDP" AI for its fantastic assistance. Without it, I'd probably have much slower progress (and much less patience) with this type of coding.
