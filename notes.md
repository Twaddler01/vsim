KNOWN BUGS:

* An unnecessary empty space is above the UPGRADE section but disappears when the CONVERT section is made visible.
* Clicking purchase buttons quickly can result in extra purchases even if resources are insufficient, causing even a negative number of resources being available.
* Sections are too easy to accidentally collapse/expand.

UPCOMING FEATURES:
* Ability to save game progres.
* Add or delete elements (instead of showing / hiding) to conserve memory.
